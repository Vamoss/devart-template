We're excited to have completed the project, it was a fun process of discovery and reflection, plus new programming challenges. 

It is our pleasure to present an interactive art platform that uses laser as language. 

The need to break the limits of light motivated us to start this project, and now we deliver it back open-source to the web, hoping to have fulfilled the requirements of DevArt.

It was a lot of effort upgrade the existent project created by Memo, and now we delivered  a easier interface with new features, as a Realtime ScreenCapture, a HTTP WebServer and a remote control by a WebApp.

We are planning a night to give remote access to people online draw pictures on the laser.

The project is alive, and it will not finish here, we still want to participate with this platform in street interventions.

We made easily to access this technology, giving tools for the people express themselves beyond laser art.
