We're excited to have completed the project, it was a fun process of discovery and reflection, plus new programming challenges. 

It is our pleasure to present an interactive art platform that uses laser as language. 

The need to break the limits of light motivated us to start this project, and now we deliver it back as a open-source project, hoping to have fulfilled the requirements of DevArt.

We put a lot of effort on upgrading the existent project created by Memo, and now we delivered  a easier user interface with new features, as a Realtime ScreenCapture, a HTTP WebServer and a remote control by a WebApp.

We are planning a night to give remote access to people online, so they can draw pictures on the laser by their selves.

We've made this technology easier to access, delivering this as a tools for the people express themselves beyond laser art.
