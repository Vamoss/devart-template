The first project challenge was to find the right hardware to perform customized images with laser.

It needs to have a ILDA interface(http://www.laserist.org/), and a Ether-dream DAC(http://ether-dream.com/) to communicate with a computer.

As this technology is new for me, I need to test how far the laser light goes.

The result is amazing:
